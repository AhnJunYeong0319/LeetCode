The third part of algorithm specialization course (coursera lecture) begins on August 2nd. Therfore I'm planning to solve as many problems as possible before 8/2/22 and 2 or 3 problems in every two days after the course begins.

<Special marks>
★ : For problems that are worth revisiting or require skills I didn't know before.<br>
★★ : For problems that give me food-for-thoughts or were beyond my level at the very moment that I referrenced leetcode solutions.<br>
★★★ : For problems that I was not able to solve by myself at the time<br><br>
